description: 'App That Converts Functions To Arrow Functions'
---
This was a Hack Week Project where I hade limited time.
This was an atempt to turn oldschool functions into more modern day arrow functions.
Its not perfect as it is based on the way I used to write functions so it might not work aswell with other ways of writing code.

You can either write in the textarea or upload a javascript file to have its content converted.

Made using: NextJS, Javascript, Css
